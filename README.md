1. Design and implement a simple API that provides the user with the functionality of authentication.
2. The API should be easy to understand and integrate with. RESTful is a welcomed approach.
3. The language must be Java and you can use any framework/libraries such as Spring Boot, Dropwizard, Jackson, etc.
4. Donâ€™t worry about persistence as data can be handled solely in memory.
5. You should make your code production-ready as much as possible.
6. The project

 java -jar target/Authenticator-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar server
