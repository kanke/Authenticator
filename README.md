##  Original Problem Statement ##

1. Design and implement a simple API that provides the user with the functionality of authentication.
2. The API should be easy to understand and integrate with. RESTful is a welcomed approach.
3. The language must be Java and you can use any framework/libraries such as Spring Boot, Dropwizard, Jackson, etc.
4. Donâ€™t worry about persistence as data can be handled solely in memory.

##  Assumptions ##


##  Future Implementations ##
1. Version API - Format versions should go in headersâ€”Accept-Version and Content-Versionâ€”in the request and response
2. Containerised application - Using maven plugin or docker file
3. Access policies - Restrictions from certain networks, rate limits, guidance of caching of API call content
   etcetera
4. Add terms & conditions and legal obligations
