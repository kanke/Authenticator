##  Original Problem Statement ##

1. Design and implement a simple API that provides the user with the functionality of authentication.
2. The API should be easy to understand and integrate with. RESTful is a welcomed approach.
3. The language must be Java and you can use any framework/libraries such as Spring Boot, Dropwizard, Jackson, etc.
4. Donâ€™t worry about persistence as data can be handled solely in memory.
5. You should make your code production-ready as much as possible.
6. The project should have a brief description of how to run the service and interact with its API.
7. It shouldnâ€™t take you more than a couple of hours to complete the exercise as this is going to be the basis for your face-to-face interview.
8. When done, please send us your project via email to recruitment@callsign.com.
9. Note: It is forbidden to upload this assignment to any public repository or website, such as Github, Bitbucket, etc.
